# Markdown

## Origin

***Markdown*** is a markup language created by **John Gruber** in 2004. It's normally used for **instant messaging** and in blogs, because it's easy to read in its **source code form**.


## Features
Markdown has many useful features. The one that's used the *most* is its **coding format**. For example:

```
if (i>=0 && i<=7){
        n++;
        i++;
    }
```
This language also provides **ordered** and **unordered lists**, such as:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

- One
- Two
- Three

It can also create **tables**:

| Title 1 | Title 2 |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Item 1-1 | Item 2-1 |
| Item 1-2 | Item 2-2 |

Finally, by using this language you are also able to create **links** to other [files](example.md) or [URLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and also **images**, such as this one:
