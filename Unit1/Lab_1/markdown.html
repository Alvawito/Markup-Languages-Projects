<h1 id="markdown">Markdown</h1>
<h2 id="origin-and-purpose">Origin and purpose</h2>
<p><em><strong>Markdown</strong></em> is a <strong>lightweight markup language</strong> created by <strong>John Gruber</strong> in 2004. Its main purpose is being an alternative to <em><a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a></em> in terms of <strong>simplicity</strong>, but it can also be used for any kind of texts. Overall, you can either use it as <strong>an <em>HTML</em> converter</strong> or <strong>an independent language</strong>. </p>

<h2 id="why-markdown">Why Markdown?</h2>
<p>As I said before, it&#39;s one of the simplest languages to perform <em><strong>all sorts of tasks</strong></em>. In its converter form, it&#39;s widely used in <strong>blog sites</strong> like <strong>WordPress</strong> or <strong>forums</strong> like <strong>Stackoverflow</strong>. Both of them support <em>HTML</em>, as nearly every single page in the <strong>Internet</strong>. </p>
<p>If we talk about it as an independent language, though, it can also be utilized in <strong>offline texts</strong> with the help of <a href="https://markdown.es/editores-markdown/">a number of apps</a>, or even in the <strong>redaction of e-books</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="features-advantages-and-disadvantages">Features, advantages and disadvantages</h2>
<p>Markdown has many features, but we can highlight some of them as the most important ones, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>Headings:</li>
</ul>
<p><code># heading here</code></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bold</strong>, <em>italics</em> or <em><strong>both</strong></em>:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>**bold**, *italics*, ***both***</code></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="example.md">Links</a> and images:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>[title](url) for links, ![text](url) for images</code></p>
<p>Now, we&#39;ll see some pros and cons about this markup language:</p>
<h3 id="advantages">Advantages</h3>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>It&#39;s simple to use, because of its intuitive syntax and the use of plain text.</li>
<li>It&#39;s supported by many devices, even mobile ones, and easy to convert.</li>
<li>It&#39;s compatible with version control systems, such as Git.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h3>
<hr>
<ol>
<li>This language has no standards, so some apps might handle Markdown syntax differently</li>
<li>It lacks formatting option because of its extreme simplicity</li>
<li>Creating interactive content is nearly impossible</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="html-vs-markdown">HTML vs Markdown</h2>
<p>Even with all the advantages listed before, <em>HTML</em> is significantly the primary markup language and well above Markdown in terms of popularity. Here&#39;s a table that compares some features they have in common:</p>
