# Markdown

## Origin and purpose

***Markdown*** is a **lightweight markup language** created by **John Gruber** in 2004. Its main purpose is being an alternative to *[HTML](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)* in terms of **simplicity**, but it can also be used for any kind of texts. Overall, you can either use it as **an *HTML* converter** or **an independent language**.

## Why Markdown?

As I said before, it's one of the simplest languages to perform ***all sorts of tasks***. In its converter form, it's widely used in **blog sites** like **WordPress** or **forums** like **Stackoverflow**. Both of them support *HTML*, as nearly every single page in the **Internet**. 

If we talk about it as an independent language, though, it can also be utilized in **offline texts** with the help of [a number of apps](https://markdown.es/editores-markdown/), or even in the **redaction of e-books**.

## Features, advantages and disadvantages
Markdown has many features, but we can highlight some of them as the most important ones, such as: 

* Headings: 

`# heading here`

* **Bold**, *italics* or ***both***:

`**bold**, *italics*, ***both***`

* [Links](example.md) and images:

`[title](url) for links, ![text](url) for images`

Now, we'll see some pros and cons about this markup language:

### Advantages
---
1. It's simple to use, because of its intuitive syntax and the use of plain text.
2. It's supported by many devices, even mobile ones, and easy to convert.
3. It's compatible with version control systems, such as Git.

### Disadvantages
---
1. This language has no standards, so some apps might handle Markdown syntax differently
2. It lacks formatting option because of its extreme simplicity
3. Creating interactive content is nearly impossible

## HTML vs Markdown
Even with all the advantages listed before, *HTML* is significantly the primary markup language and well above Markdown in terms of popularity. Here's a table that compares some features they have in common:


| Feature\Language | HTML | Markdown |
|:------------------:|------|----------|
|Text Formatting| Great control over format (heading, paragraph, list, underlines, layout...) | Basic text formatting (heading, bold, italics, lists) |
|Links| Full control over attributes like link behavior (ex: new tab or same tab) | Basic link creation, no excessive markup |
|Headers| 6 sizes of headers (h1 to h6) | Also 6 sizes, from # to ###### |
|Images| Capability of embedding, image display, behavior options... | Embedding and almost no ability to personalize an image |
|Tables| Precise table customization and ability to create large and complex tables | Simple tables and complex syntax, lacks table design
