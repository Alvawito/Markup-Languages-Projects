# Markdown

## Origin and purpose

***Markdown*** is a **lightweight markup language** created by **John Gruber** in 2004. Its main purpose is being an alternative to *[HTML](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)* in terms of **simplicity**, but it can also be used for any kind of texts. Overall, you can either use it as **an *HTML* converter** or **an independent language**.

## Why Markdown?

As I said before, it's one of the simplest languages to perform ***all sorts of tasks***. In its converter form, it's widely used in **blog sites** like **WordPress** or **forums** like **Stackoverflow**. Both of them support *HTML*, as nearly every single page in the **Internet**. 

If we talk about it as an independent language, though, it can also be utilized in **offline texts** with the help of [a number of apps](https://markdown.es/editores-markdown/), or even in the **redaction of e-books**.

## Features, advantages and disadvantages

## Comparisons
Even with all the advantages listed before, *HTML* is significantly the primary markup language and well above Markdown in terms of popularity
